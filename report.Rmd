# 📊 Regression Analysis: 3-Point Attempts vs. Total Points

We test the hypothesis that players who take more three-point shots tend to score more total points over a season (after removing anyone with fewer than 10 attempts).

## Regression Results

```{r three_pt_reg_table, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(here)
library(gtsummary)

# Load the saved gtsummary object
reg_table <- readRDS(here("Outputs/3pts_reg_table.rds"))

# Render it as an HTML table
reg_table
```

## Table interpretation:

*Estimate shows the intercept and the slope for X3PA (three-point attempts).
*The Std. Error and t value assess the precision of those estimates.
*The Pr(>|t|) p-value for X3PA tells us if the relationship is statistically significant (< 0.05).

## Scatter Plot
```{r}

library(knitr)

knitr::include_graphics(here("Outputs/three_pt_regression_plot.png"))
```

## Plot interpretation:

Each dot represents one player’s season: x = number of three-point attempts, y = total points scored.
The blue line is the linear “best fit.”
